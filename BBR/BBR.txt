rwnd: receive window size
cwnd: congestion control window size, also in-flight bytes

TCP flow control: traffic between sender and receiver(rwnd)
congestion control: traffic placed by transport layer into the network(cwnd)
=> # of bytes to send = min(rwnd, cwnd)

loss-based congestion control:
1. reduce cwnd when loss detected
2. linearly increase cwnd until next loss happens
potential problem: excessive buffering of packets
network devices have larger and larger buffer, so when packet loss is detected,
the actual in-flight bytes is bandwidth + buffer size
[right edge of figure1]

BBR detects the beginning of filling of bandwidth(the left edge of figure1), by
detecting effective bandwidth(without buffer) no longer grows; in other words,
begins to utilize buffer

note: they cannot be calculated at the same time
since RTT needs empty network environment, while bandwith needs to fully fill it
