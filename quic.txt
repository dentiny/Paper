1. connection establishment:
(1) QUIC relies on a combined cryptographic and transport handshake for setting
up a secure transport connection
(2) on a successful handshake, client caches information about the origin
(identified by URI schema, hostname, port); subsequent connections to the same 
origin, clients establish encrypted connection with no additional round trip
(3) version negotiation at the beginning of connection

2. loss recovery:
(1) TCP uses sequence number, original packet and retransmission packet have 
the same seq; QUIC assigns new packet number for each packet
(2) QUIC gets RTT (estimation) for packets, good for delay-based congestion
control
(3) QUICâ€™s acknowledgments support up to 256 ACK blocks, making QUIC more 
resilient to reordering and loss than TCP with SACK

3. flow control:
supports stream-based and connection-based flow control

4. NAT rebinding and connection migration:
(1) QUIC connection is identified by a ConnectionID, which enables connection
to survive change to the clients' IP and port change
(2) change could be caused by NAT timeout and rebinding, or client changing 
network connectivity
NAT timeout for TCP is 24 hours (magnitude), for UDP is 5 minutes (magnitude)
