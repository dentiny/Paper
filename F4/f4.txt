Design for Haystack:
1. Bundle blobs into a volume (reduce IO and metadata overhead)
2. Index file is kept in memory

motivation for warm storage:
1. Temporature zone (access pattern) exists
2. Hot tier and warm tier is differentiated via access latency SLO

storage architecture:
1. CDN protects storage
2. router abstracts storage
3. web tier adds business logic
4. Haystack for hot storage, F4 for warm storage
