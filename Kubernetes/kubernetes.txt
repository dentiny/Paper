1. application-oriented: 
eg: (1) load-balancing is performed in the unit of application, rather than machine
(2) log is keyed by application

2. nested containers could be co-scheduled on the same machine:
(1) the ourtermost one provides a pool of resources
(2) the inner one provide deployment isolation
(3) Borg calls the outer one "alloc", Kubernetes calls the outer one "pod"

3. reconciliation controller loop:
compare a desired state(eg, how many pods should match a label selector query) 
against the observed state, and takes actions to converge the observed and desired 
states
