design goal:
(1) world-wide, geographically-distributed data-centers
(2) weak-consistency model

architecture:
(1) table is partitioned into tablets, in one region, there's only one copy 
(tablet) for each data
(2) tablet controller manages interval mapping (which knows data belongs to 
which tablet), manages tablet's split and merge
(3) tablet controller is the SPOF (Single Point of Failure), but not bottleneck,
since it's not in the datapath
(4) router keeps cached version of interval mapping, periodically poll and 
update interval mapping; it handles request
(5) YMB (Message Broker) is topic-based pub/sub, and performs asynchronously 
replication across regions

consistency model: per-record timeline consistency model
(1) all replicas of a given record apply all updates to the record in the same
order
(2) consistency provided by designating one copy of a record as the same master,
and directly all updates to the master copy
(3) make no guarantees as to consistency for multi-record transactions
