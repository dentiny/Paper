GWP collects two categories of profiles: whole-machine and per-process.

Whole machine profiles capture all activities happening on the machine,
including user applications, the kernel, kernel modules, daemons, and other
background jobs. The whole machine profiles include hardware performance
monitoring (HPM) event profiles, kernel event traces, and power measurements.

The most commonly used generic events are CPU cycles, retired instructions,
L1 and L2 cache misses, and branch mispredictions.

Most applications include a common library that enables process-wide
stacktrace-attributed profiling mechanisms for heap allocation, lock contention,
wall time and CPU time, and other performance metrics.

Symbolization: An alternative is to persistently store binaries that contain
debug information before theyâ€™re stripped.
