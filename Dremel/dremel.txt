enhancement for MapReduce:
1. query pushed down the tree and rewritten at each step, results are assembled
by aggregating the replies received from lower levels of the tree
2. provides high-level SQL declarative language to express query
3. leverage column-striped storage representation, which enables it to read 
less data from secondary storage and reduce CPU cost due to compression
