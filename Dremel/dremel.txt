high-level introduction to Dremel:
1. doesn't support creates and updates, it's used for read-only operations
2. query pushed down the tree and rewritten at each step, results are assembled
by aggregating the replies received from lower levels of the tree
3. provides high-level SQL declarative language to express query
4. leverage column-striped storage representation, which enables it to read 
less data from secondary storage and reduce CPU cost due to compression
- internal Google use protobuf (nested structure), Dremel converts it into 
columnar storage
5. Comparison with Hadoop (open-source version for MapReduce):
1/ Hadoop also allows data analysis on massive datasets using SQL-like syntax
2/ it doesn't leverage columnar IO, instead it leverages table indexing
