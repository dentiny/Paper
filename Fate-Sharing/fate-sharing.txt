Stateless networks’ principle: fate-sharing
(1) The conversation shares the same fate with the “ends”
(2) “it is acceptable to lose the state information associated with an entity 
if, at the same time, the entity itself is lost.”

Advantages
(1) Fate-sharing protects against any number of intermediate network failures 
While protect within intermediate network needs replication, only protects 
limited # of failures
(2) Fate-sharing is much easier to engineer.

The result: a “best-effort” network
(1) The IP (Internet Protocol) layer doesn’t really provide anything other than
“best-effort” delivery (i.e., addressing and routing).
(2) The end hosts provide conversation protection mechanisms
