Current problems:
1. High-bandwidth links result in performance bottlenecks shifting from protocol
processing to data copy.
2. The reducing gap between bandwidth-delay product (BDP) and cache sizes leads
to suboptimal throughput.
3. Host resource sharing considered harmful.

Potential improvements:
1. zero-copy mechanism:
(1) message send zero-copy: https://lwn.net/Articles/726917/
(2) message receive zero-copy: https://lwn.net/Articles/752188/
2. Linux network NAPI:
(1) interrupt mitigation:
1/ alternative to purely interrupt-based
2/ poll on incoming frames until certain number of frames received or deadline
(2) packet throttling: driver drops packets in network adaptor before processed
