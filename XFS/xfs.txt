XFS: enhancement for traditional file system
(1) fast crash recovery
(2) ability to support large, sparse files
(3) ability to support large, contiguous files
(4) ability to support large directories
(5) support large number of files

B+ tree:
1. track free extents in file system instead of bitmap
2. index directory entries rather than linear lookup structures
3. track dynamically allocated inodes scattered throughout the file system

allocation group:
1. keep the size of XFS data structures in a range where they can operate 
efficiently without breaking the file system into an unmanageable number of 
pieces
2. allow for parallelism in the management of free space and inode allocation
