1. libOS: a special collection of libraries that provides needed OS functions
in a compilable format.

2. monolithic kernel: when a program runs, there's kernel and user space
unikernel: There's only one program running(one single image) and it contains
everything from high-level application to low-level device IO routine. It
requires no shared libraries and no OS; it's a completely self-contained env-
ironment and can be deposited into a blank virtual machine and boot up.

3. docker vs unikernel: docker depends on hostOS, hypervisor, and daemon

conclusion:
(1) package hardware abstraction into libOS and link with application as much
as possible
(2) kernel only takes care of multiplexing among mutiple libOS
(3) docker leverages hypervisor as its kernel
