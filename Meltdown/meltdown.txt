Q: What vulnerability does Meltdown exploit to dump kernel memory?
A: Design flaws in CPU

Q: Why does Linux kernel (before meltdown) map kernel memory when executing 
user programs?
A: For Fast system call performance

Q: Why is exception handling or exception suppression important to launch a 
meltdown attack?
A: To prevent the attackerâ€™s process being killed by the OS

Q: What prevents a process from reading kernel memory?
The protection mechanism of virtual memory. There's a premission bit of U/S on 
page table, and OS checks permission of the program which try to access the 
location of the memory. If the code tries to access an address which is not 
allowed to access under the current permission, an exception will be triggered.

Why is it broken?
Microarchitecture does performance optimization and will execute instructions 
out-of-order. When an instruction is fetched and executed out-of-order, it's 
permission won't be checked. After instructions have been executed and a fault 
is detected, the architecture will rollback data in mem and reg, but not in 
cache. So it's possible to get data inside of kernel from cache.
 
Q2: The key building blocks of Meltdown are (1) executing transient 
instructions and (2) building a covert channel. Explain what they mean in the 
context of Meltdown and why each of them is important.

(1) Transient instructions means an instruction should never be executed, for 
this situation, it's the instruction which visits data in kernel space in user 
mode. But in fact, it actually is prefetched and executed in a fashion of 
out-of-order before its permission bit is checked. After the permission check 
fails, data generated in mem and reg will be rollbacked, but those in cache 
won't be recovered.

(2) building a covert channel
It means using a flush and reload to launch cache attack. Since the data from 
kernel space is left in cache, we could use build a covert channel to get that 
data, with detecting the access time of a bunch of addresses. In a word, this 
is the way where the malicious program finds the value of what was loaded in 
the cache, namely we could get kernel data.
