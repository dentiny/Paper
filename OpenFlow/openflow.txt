components for OpenFlow:
1. Flow Table, with an action associated with each flow entry, to tell the 
switch how to process the flow
actions:
(1) forward packet to a given port(s)
(2) encapsulate and forward packets to Secure Channel
It's typically used for the first packet in a new flow, so controller can
decide whether the flow should be added to the Flow Table
(3) drop the packet
(4) forward packets through switch's normal processing pipeline
2. Secure Channel, connects the switch to a remote control process(namely, 
controller)
controller adds or remove entries to/from the Flow Table
3. OpenFlow Protocol, provides an open and standard way for a controller to 
communicate with a switch

some use-cases for OpenFlow:
(1) simple forward, which changes the original routing rule
(2) load balancing
(3) firewall
(4) provide isolated network, like VLAN
