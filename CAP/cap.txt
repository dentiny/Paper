Difference for 'C' in ACID and CAP:
- C in ACID: transaction brings database from one consistent state to another,
perserving database invariants
- C in CAP: linearizability, as if there's only one copy

Understanding for CAP:
- Partition is rare, there's little reason to forfeit C or A when system is not
partitioned
- availability is continuous from 0 to 100 percent, therere also many levels of
consistency
- a partition is a time bound on communication

How to deal with network partition:
- detect the start of a partition
- enter an explicit partition mode that limit some operations
- initiate partition recovery when communication is restored
