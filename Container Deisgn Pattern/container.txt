sidecar pattern: Deploy components of an application into a separate process 
or container to provide isolation and encapsulation.
Suppose a monolithic application has a webserver and logserver.
1. container is the unit of resource accounting and allocation
webserver should have lower latency, while logserver could ensure longer
2. container is the unit of packaging
webserver and logserver could be developped, tested, and packaged seperately
3. container is the unit of reuse
4. container provides failure containment boundary
webserver still serves when logserver fails
5. container is the unit of deployment
allows each piece to update, rollback; but every combination shoud be tested

ambassador pattern: Create helper services that send network requests on behalf
of a consumer service or application.
1. application communicates with ambassador container
2. ambassador actually proxy to different shards

adaptor pattern: present the outside world with a simplified, homogenized view
of an application
