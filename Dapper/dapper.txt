1. three attributes for tracing:
(1) trace: basic unit of tracing
(2) span: trace is organized as tree of spans, every span has its unique id
and parent span
(3) annotation: provide additional information for span

2. performance improvement:
(1) use sampling instead of recording every event
(2) 1/ span data written to local log files
2/ pulled from production hosts by dapper deamon
3/ write to a cell of BigTable repository
