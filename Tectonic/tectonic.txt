Motivation:
- Haystack is for new blobs, bottlenecked on IOPS but has spare disk space
- F4 is for old blobs, bottlenecked at disk space but has spare IO capacity

Metadata service features:
1. Layered: splitted to name, file, block, and only expose to outside as "name"
2. Use ZippyDB (linearizable, sharded, key-value storage) to store metadata
3. expanded map: avoid update to one value load and update all values
cascadingly; so use key-value as the whole key to store in DB
4. shard by hashing
