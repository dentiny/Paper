four ways for docker networking:
1. bridge
(1) exclusively for container communication on the same host
(2) each container has its own independent IP address, OS kernel routes between
these containers

2. host
(1) container directly use the IP address of host network interface, and 
containers cannot be configured their own IP address
(2) the performance is close to the performance of directly using host's network

3. Macvlan
(1) allow the physical NIC to emulate multiple NICs each with a different MAC 
address and IP address
(2) complicates data center network routing
(3) containers must choose IP address which don't overlap with other containers

4. overlay
(1) it's mostly the same network overlay way as virtual machines:
application -> overlay network stack -> vSwitch -> host network stack
(2) 1/ each application has its own network namespace and cgroup
2/ a virtual network interface is created per container
3/ the virtual network interface communicates with the outside with vSwitch
(3) thus container has its own IP address and network configuration
