Two types of operations:
- per-byte operation: copy, checksum
- per-packet operation: header processing, memory management

Motivation:
As CPU prefetching (move data from memory to cache) increases, overhead switches
from per-byte operation to per-packet operation

Two methods:
- receive aggregation: 
(1) aggregate multiple incoming packets for the same TCP connection into single
large packet
- acknowledgement offload:
(1) instead of generating a sequence of acknowledgement packets, TCP stack
generates a single TCP acknowledgement packet template
(2) reduce the number of ack packets to be processed by the TCP transmit side
