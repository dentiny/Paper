database query engine architecture:
1. parser: convert SQL string into AST, which contains table and column
2. binder: convert tokenized string into internal indentifier, via catalog
manager
3. rewriter: implements basic optmization, like constant folding
4. optimizer: convert logical plan into physical plan, which is taken as the
input for query executor

components for query optimizer:
- search space (a space of plans)
- cost estimation, so that a cost may be assigned to each plan of resources 
needed for the execution
- enumeration algorithm, which can search through the search space
