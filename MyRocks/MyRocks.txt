InnoDB cons: DDIA P84
(1) storage inefficiency, especially bad for SSD storage(Facebook has turned
	to complete SSD storage)
	1/ index fragmentation: when a page is split or when a row cannot fit into
	an existing page, some space remain unused
	2/ compression inefficiency: storage inefficiency
	3/ space overhead per row for handling txns
(2) write amplification and could cause occasional stalls(2.2)
	eg: write several bytes could cause a whole page's overwrite

UDB(User Database):
1. TAO: cache layer for underlying DB layer
2. DB layer replication:
(1) async for cross-region replication
(2) semi-sync(one sync, other async) for for in-region replication
(3) binlog: 1/ for replication
	2/ for wormhole(distributed pub-sub service) to invalidate TAO

design goal:
1. better space optimized, lower write amplification
2. LSM-Tree better friendly to tiered storage
3. performance and efficiency goal(3.2.2)
	1/ reduce db space by at least 50%
	2/ achieve without regression CPU and IO usage
