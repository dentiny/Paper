1. kernel provides program environment as virtualized hardware
application runs directly on (virtualized) hardware

ch2.2:
To provide the maximum opportunity for application-level resource management, 
the exokernel architecture consists of a thin exokernel veneer that multiplexes
and exports physical resources securely through a set of low-level primitives.

2. customization:
monolithic kernel: overly general
	- multiplex resource among competing applications with different demands

3. security:
(1) exokernel provides secure resource multiplexing by secure binding
(2) secure binding decouples authorization from the actual use of a resource
It performs authorization at bind time, and implement access checks at access 
time without understanding them.
