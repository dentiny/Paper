For communication, infrastructure and middleware provides performance,
application provides reliability.

(1) Low-level system doesn't know the whole story(eg, checksum for file
transferred) thus have to implement end-to-end check and retry. Extra effort
expended in the communication system only reduces frequency of retries from
application level.
(2) Low-level system may be common component for several upper-level
applications, some may not require "reliability" guarentee.
